A blank template for developing PHP apps on [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/php/).

The template already includes [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/) and jQuery.

Before testing on a dev server, be sure to change the `application: <project-id>` to the project id of the app.
